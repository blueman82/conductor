# Integration Test Plan: Simple Linear

**Created**: 2025-11-10
**Estimated Tasks**: 2

## Task 1: First Task

**File(s)**: `main.py`
**Estimated time**: 10m
**Agent**: python-pro

### What you're building
A Python script that prints "Hello from Task 1" to the console.

### Implementation
Create a file `main.py` with a simple Python script that prints "Hello from Task 1" when executed. The script should run without errors.

**Success Criteria:**
- File `main.py` created with valid Python code
- Script prints 'Hello from Task 1' when executed

## Task 2: Second Task

**File(s)**: `main.py`
**Depends on**: 1
**Estimated time**: 10m
**Agent**: python-pro

### What you're building
Enhance the Python script from Task 1 to print both "Hello from Task 1" and "Hello from Task 2".

### Implementation
Modify the existing file `main.py` to add a line that prints "Hello from Task 2". The script should output both messages in the correct order when executed.

**Success Criteria:**
- File `main.py` modified correctly
- Script prints both messages in correct order
