        Create a Python script that prints "Hello from Task 1" to the console.

        **Required Actions:**
        1. Create a file `main.py`
        2. Write a simple Python script that prints "Hello from Task 1"
        3. The script should execute without errors

        **Success Criteria:**
        - File `main.py` exists and is valid Python
        - Running the script produces the correct output

        Enhance the Python script from Task 1 to also print "Hello from Task 2".

        **Required Actions:**
        1. Modify the existing file `main.py`
        2. Add a line that prints "Hello from Task 2"
        3. The script should execute without errors
        4. Output both messages in order

        **Success Criteria:**
        - File `main.py` is modified correctly
        - Running the script produces both output lines

            [code-reviewer] Task 2 successfully integrated with Task 1. Both test commands passed: (1) Python syntax validation confirmed main.py is valid, (2) Script execution shows both 'Hello from Task 1' and 'Hello from Task 2' printed in correct order. File main.py modified correctly at the required path. All success criteria verified.
            [python-pro] All success criteria met. File main.py correctly modified to integrate Task 2. Both test commands passed: compilation succeeded and script output contains both 'Hello from Task 1' and 'Hello from Task 2' in correct order. Integration with Task 1 verified successfully.
            [fullstack-developer] Task 2 successfully integrated. main.py modified to include both Task 1 and Task 2 output. All success criteria met: file modified correctly at exact path, both messages print in correct order. All test commands passed (compilation check and grep verification for both 'Hello from Task 1' and 'Hello from Task 2').
            [python-integration-specialist] Task 2 successfully integrated with Task 1. Both test commands pass: main.py compiles without errors and script output contains both 'Hello from Task 1' and 'Hello from Task 2' in correct order. File modified at exact required path.
