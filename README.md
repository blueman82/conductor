# Conductor

Autonomous multi-agent orchestration system for executing implementation plans with Claude Code agents.

## Overview

Conductor is a Go-based CLI tool that executes implementation plans by spawning and managing multiple Claude Code CLI agents in coordinated waves. It parses implementation plans (Markdown or YAML), calculates task dependencies, and orchestrates parallel execution with quality control.

## Project Status

**Status**: Initial Setup / Prerequisites Complete

This project is currently in the initial setup phase. See `docs/plans/conductor-v1-implementation.md` for the full implementation roadmap.

## Prerequisites

## Development

This project follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles:

1. Write tests first
2. Implement to make tests pass
3. Refactor
4. Commit frequently
