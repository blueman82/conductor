# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Conductor is an autonomous multi-agent orchestration CLI built in Go that executes implementation plans by spawning and managing multiple Claude Code CLI agents in coordinated waves. It parses plan files (Markdown or YAML), calculates task dependencies using graph algorithms, and orchestrates parallel execution with quality control reviews.

**Current Status**: Foundation complete (10/25 tasks). Core infrastructure works but orchestration engine not yet implemented. The binary compiles and shows version/help but cannot execute plans end-to-end.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run all tests with coverage
go test ./... -cover

# Run tests for specific package
go test ./internal/parser/ -v

go vet ./...
```

## Architecture Overview

### High-Level Flow
```
Plan File (.md/.yaml)
  → Parser (auto-detects format)
  → Dependency Graph Builder (validates, detects cycles)
  → Wave Calculator (Kahn's algorithm for topological sort)
  → Orchestrator (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
  → Wave Executor (spawns parallel tasks)
  → Task Executor (invokes claude CLI, handles retries)
  → Quality Control (reviews output, decides GREEN/RED/YELLOW)
  → Plan Updater (marks tasks complete)
```

### Key Components

**Parser (`internal/parser/`)**: Auto-detects file format and parses plan files into Task structs. Markdown parser extracts tasks from `## Task N:` headings. YAML parser handles structured format. Both support optional YAML frontmatter for conductor config.

**Models (`internal/models/`)**: Core data structures (Task, Plan, Wave, TaskResult). Task.DependsOn creates dependency graph. Wave groups parallel-executable tasks.

**Executor (`internal/executor/`)**:
- `graph.go`: Dependency graph builder using Kahn's algorithm for wave calculation. DFS with color marking for cycle detection. Validates all dependencies exist.
- `qc.go`: Quality control reviews using dedicated agent. Parses GREEN/RED/YELLOW flags from output. Handles retry logic (max 2 attempts on RED).

**Agent (`internal/agent/`)**:
- `discovery.go`: Scans `~/.claude/agents/` for agent .md files with YAML frontmatter. Registry provides fast agent lookup.
- `invoker.go`: Executes `claude -p` commands with proper flags. Always disables hooks, uses JSON output format. Prefixes prompts with "use the {agent} subagent to:" when agent specified.

**CLI (`internal/cmd/`)**: Cobra root command. Subcommands (`run`, `validate`) not yet implemented.

### Dependency Graph Algorithm

Uses **Kahn's algorithm** for topological sort with wave grouping:
1. Calculate in-degree for each task (number of dependencies)
2. Wave 1: All tasks with in-degree 0 (no dependencies)
3. Process wave, decrease in-degree of dependent tasks
4. Wave N: Tasks that now have in-degree 0
5. Repeat until all tasks processed

Cycle detection uses **DFS with color marking**:
- White (0): Not visited
- Gray (1): Currently visiting (on recursion stack)
- Black (2): Fully visited
- Back edge (gray → gray) = cycle detected

### Claude CLI Invocation Pattern

All agent invocations follow this structure:
```go
args := []string{
    "-p",  // Non-interactive print mode
    prompt,
    "--settings", `{"disableAllHooks": true}`,  // No user hooks
    "--output-format", "json",  // Structured output
}
cmd := exec.CommandContext(ctx, "claude", args...)
```

Agent references are added by prefixing prompt:
```go
prompt = fmt.Sprintf("use the %s subagent to: %s", agent, task.Prompt)
```

### Quality Control Pattern

QC reviews follow structured format:
```
Review the following task execution:

Task: {task.Name}

Output:
{output}

Provide quality control review in this format:
Quality Control: [GREEN/RED/YELLOW]

Feedback: [your detailed feedback]
```

Parser extracts flag via regex: `Quality Control:\s*(GREEN|RED|YELLOW)`

Retry logic: Only retry on RED, up to MaxRetries (default: 2)

## Test-Driven Development

**This project follows strict TDD**:
1. **Red**: Write failing test first
2. **Green**: Implement minimal code to pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve code quality
4. **Commit**: Commit after each completed task

### Test Organization
- Test files live alongside source: `foo.go` → `foo_test.go`
- Test fixtures in `internal/{package}/testdata/`
- Table-driven tests using `t.Run()` for subtests
- Interfaces enable mocking (e.g., `InvokerInterface` for QC tests)

### Coverage Targets
- Critical paths (graph algorithms, QC logic): 90%+
- Overall target: 70%+ (currently 76.7%)

## Important Implementation Details

### File Format Detection
Extension-based auto-detection in `parser.DetectFormat()`:
- `.md`, `.markdown` → Markdown parser
- `.yaml`, `.yml` → YAML parser
- Convenience function `ParseFile()` handles detection + parsing

### Agent Discovery
Registry scans `~/.claude/agents/` on initialization:
```go
registry := agent.NewRegistry("") // Uses ~/.claude/agents default
agents, _ := registry.Discover()
if registry.Exists("quality-control") {
    // Agent available
}
```

### Context-Based Timeouts
All agent invocations accept context for cancellation:
```go
ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 5*time.Minute)
defer cancel()
result, err := invoker.Invoke(ctx, task)
```

### What's Missing (Tasks 11-16)
The foundation is complete but these critical pieces are **not yet implemented**:
- File locking for concurrent plan updates (Task 11)
- Plan updater to mark tasks complete (Task 12)
- Wave executor for parallel task execution (Task 13)
- Task executor with retry logic (Task 14)
- Main orchestration engine (Task 15)
- `conductor run` and `conductor validate` CLI commands (Tasks 16-17)

This means: **The binary compiles but cannot execute plans end-to-end yet.**

## Module Path

The Go module uses path: `github.com/harrison/conductor`

When importing internal packages:
```go
import (
    "github.com/harrison/conductor/internal/parser"
    "github.com/harrison/conductor/internal/executor"
    "github.com/harrison/conductor/internal/agent"
    "github.com/harrison/conductor/internal/models"
)
```

## Dependencies

Minimal external dependencies:
- `github.com/spf13/cobra` - CLI framework
- `github.com/yuin/goldmark` - Markdown parsing
- `gopkg.in/yaml.v3` - YAML parsing

No networking, no ML frameworks, no web frameworks. Just local CLI orchestration.
