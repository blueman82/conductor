    instructions: |
      1. Start with plan-01-foundation.yaml - Task 1
      2. Follow task dependencies as documented in each file
      3. Refer to worktree_group field for parallel execution guidance
      4. Tasks may reference tasks in other files - check depends_on field carefully
      5. Each file builds on the previous file's completed tasks
      6. Testing strategy and commit guidelines are in plan-03-completion.yaml

    # Enhanced Console Output System

    This implementation plan adds rich, informative terminal output to Conductor's
    execution pipeline. The enhancement includes progress tracking, detailed task
    information, inline QC feedback, and comprehensive execution summaries.

    ## Key Features

    - Progress tracking with task counters [N/M], ASCII progress bars, percentages
    - Detailed task info (duration, agent, file counts) in default mode
    - Full verbose mode with multi-line details and QC feedback
    - Enhanced wave completion with status breakdowns (GREEN/YELLOW/RED)
    - Comprehensive execution summary with agent usage and file statistics
    - Configuration via console section in config.yaml
    - Color scheme: cyan (progress), bright green (status), magenta (agents)

    ## Implementation Approach

    - Strict TDD with 90%+ coverage for all new code
    - 12 tasks organized into dependency chains
    - Multiple parallel worktrees for independent development
    - Thread-safe concurrent logging throughout
    - Backward compatible with existing behavior

    ## Testing Coverage

    - 7 test cases per task minimum
    - Unit tests for all components
    - Integration tests for orchestrator flow
    - Thread-safety verification
    - Color output validation

  file_format:
    format: "YAML"
    conductor_support: "Native (conductor parses YAML plans)"
    auto_discovery: "Enabled (conductor finds plan-*.yaml files in directory)"
    cross_file_dependencies: "Supported (depends_on can reference tasks across files)"

  validation:
    yaml_syntax: "All files validated with Python yaml.safe_load()"
    structure: "Complete plan structure in each file"
    dependencies: "All depends_on references valid"
    worktree_groups: "All groups defined and assigned"
    agents: "All agents verified against available agent list"
    coverage: "90%+ target specified for all tasks"
