# Plan validation configuration
# Controls strictness of plan file validation
validation:

  #   - off: Disable the check entirely
  key_point_criteria: warn

  # Enable strict rubric validation when PlannerComplianceSpec is present

# Task execution configuration (v2.9+)
# Controls behavior during task execution
executor:
  # Run dependency check commands before agent invocation (default: true)

  enforce_dependency_checks: true

  # Run test commands after agent output but before QC review (default: true)
  # When enabled, tasks with test_commands will have their commands executed
  # after the agent completes. With QC enabled: test failures trigger retry with
  # feedback injection (v2.10+). Without QC: hard gate - task fails immediately.
  # Test output is captured and attached to logs.
  enforce_test_commands: true

  # Run optional per-criterion verification commands (default: true)
  # When enabled, structured_criteria with verification blocks are executed
  # after agent output. Unlike test commands, verification failures do NOT
  # block execution - results are injected into QC prompt for final judgment.
  verify_criteria: true

  # Enforce runtime package conflict guard for Go packages (default: true)
  # When enabled, prevents concurrent task execution from modifying the same
  # Go package. Tasks must acquire package locks before execution; conflicts
  # block until released. Package conflicts are also validated at wave
  # calculation time during planning phase.
  enforce_package_guard: true

  # Enforce documentation target verification for documentation tasks (default: true)
  # When enabled, documentation targets are verified before QC to ensure
  # agents edit the exact sections specified in the plan.
  enforce_doc_targets: true

  # Enable error pattern detection on test failures (default: true)
  # When enabled, Conductor will analyze test command failures and categorize them
  # into CODE_LEVEL (agent can fix), PLAN_LEVEL (plan needs update), or ENV_LEVEL
  # (environment issue). Provides actionable suggestions for each category.
  enable_error_pattern_detection: true

# Executor Examples

# Example: Disable dependency checks for legacy plans
# executor:
#   enforce_dependency_checks: false

# Example: Skip test command execution (rely only on QC review)
# executor:
#   enforce_test_commands: false

# Example: Disable per-criterion verification (rely on QC judgment)
# executor:

# Example: Disable runtime package guard (allow concurrent package modifications)
# executor:
#   enforce_package_guard: false

# Example: Disable documentation target verification
# executor:
#   enforce_doc_targets: false

# Example: Disable error pattern detection on test failures
# executor:
#   enable_error_pattern_detection: false

# Validation Examples

# Example: Strict mode - fail validation if key_points exceed success_criteria
# validation:
#   key_point_criteria: strict

# Example: Disable key_point validation entirely
# validation:
#   key_point_criteria: off

# Example: Enable strict rubric validation for all plans with PlannerComplianceSpec
# validation:
#   strict_rubric: true
